## Overview
We have 6 styles of lists using the 3 different HTML markup techniques. Unordered lists, ordered lists and description lists.

Some components are specifically designed to include these lists. To find out which, visit the Content guidance section of the component and you'll find the types of content that can be included.

## Unordered lists

There are three list styles that can be with an unordered list. The familiar bullet list and the two decorative list styles.

Use the Unordered list element `<ul>` as the parent element and a List item `<li>` for each line.

### Bullet list
`class="ul-bullet"`

Bullet list can be nested up to four levels deep.
<ExampleViewer type="bullet-list" />

### Decorative lists
Decorative lists display different bullet styles, we have a ticked list and a crossed list.

#### Ticked list
`class="ul-ticked"`
<ExampleViewer type="ticked-list" />

#### Crossed list
`class="ul-crossed"`
<ExampleViewer type="crossed-list" />

## Ordered lists

An ordered list is used when the order is important or if there's a need to identify or refer to an individual list item within a list.

Use the Ordered list element `<ol>` as the parent element and a List item `<li>` for each line.

### Numbered list
`class="ol-numbered"`

The Numbered list will display an incremental number alongside each list item. A Numbered list can be nested up to four levels deep.
<ExampleViewer type="numbered-list" />

### Description list
Displaying data alongside it's accompanying label is accomplished using the Description List element `<dl>` and it's children `<dt>` and `<dd>` wrapped in a `<div>`.

There are two types of description lists which we have called `dl-row` and `dl-stack`.

#### Description list row
`class="dl-row"`
<ExampleViewer type="description-list-row" />

#### Description list stack
`class="dl-stack"`
<ExampleViewer type="description-list-stack" />
