## Where to start

<div class="purpose">
Use this documentation to get accustomed to Nucleus and explore what it offers.
Seek feedback through Nucleus channels on Github or Teams.
Reach out to any member of the Nucleus team, start a conversation and ask questions.

## Designing

Depending on which stage of their design or discovery work a person is at, the Nucleus team has a growing body of reusable assets, tools, methods and knowledge that can help them create feasible design mock-ups and prototypes. The team can help visualise ideas and would encourage individuals to:

- Familiarise themselves with the provided documentation and component examples.
- Check out the Nucleus Playground for an easy, visual way to prototype with the components.
- Use the [Playground support channel on Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a10af1f515b714d0cb7e30a8e8d0848c7%40thread.tacv2/%25F0%259F%258E%25A1%2520Playground%2520support?groupId=1f9c2411-216b-42a8-9bb0-c51f28ff5071&tenantId=a603898f-7de2-45ba-b67d-d35fb519b2cf) for any queries.
- Take prototypes into testing on any browser and device, as well as test for accessibility using different assistive technology.
- Use the Nucleus Figma UI kit library comprising Components and Foundations for mock-ups, which is automatically available to anyone who joins the British Gas workspace.
- Reach out to the dedicated [Figma support Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A4bb5fc77f44245e182cc69b3f6e0417b%40thread.tacv2/%E2%9C%8F%EF%B8%8F%20Figma%20Support?groupId=1f9c2411-216b-42a8-9bb0-c51f28ff5071&tenantId=a603898f-7de2-45ba-b67d-d35fb519b2cf) for any questions.
- Work with the Nucleus team to explore the feasibility of their concepts.
- Collaborate with their engineers and involve them in their discovery work.
  
## Developing

When you build using Nucleus you will be able to use already tested, plug-and-play front-end components. You can find a dedicated wiki for using the design system with in our Ember applications here:

[https://github.com/ConnectedHomes/ember-commons/wiki/Nucleus](https://github.com/ConnectedHomes/ember-commons/wiki/Nucleus)

We have already had a number of successful collaborations with engineers across our teams. We would love you to help shape and improve our design system - come and speak to us.

## Testing

Once we have completed development we make sure the quality of Nucleus meets our standards.

Testing plays a vital role in order to validate and check the quality of our work. In addition to this, regression testing is performed to confirm that any recent addition or changes have not adversely affected existing features.

There are many ways to access [www.britishgas.co.uk](https://www.britishgas.co.uk/) and we strive to ensure it's as accessible as possible.

See the current list of [browsers and devices](/guidelines/devices/#browsers) identified as the most popular used by our customers.

## Product owners and business analysts

While you might not need in-depth knowledge of our shared UI styles and components, understanding their principles and requirements will help when you're reviewing current Proposals and discussing work ahead. We hope that you push your product teams to explore feasibility of existing assets before resolving to build custom, once-off components. After all, we believe the former will lead to better results for our business in the long run.

We're working towards an evidence driven and purposeful use of UI components. If you think an asset of ours is performing particularly well or poorly in a certain context, please let us know. It will help us curate and improve our shared assets and documentation.

## Content managers

Sometimes things get squeezed in where they shouldn't. We hope that with shared documentation and tools available, you'll see less of this taking place. One means for this change will be our growing body of shared, brand aligned, plug and play assets. Another one will be tools like Storybook that help us stress test and collaborate on content with more ease. We also know that changing workflows takes some time and practice. To get there faster, we hope you'll also study the guidance provided here, the better to suggest alternative solutions when needed.
