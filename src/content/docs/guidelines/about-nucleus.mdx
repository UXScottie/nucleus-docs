### The purpose

Empowering teams to collaboratively build reusable, coherent and accessible experiences that delight customers by using our aligned principles and processes.

### Accessibility and inclusivity principles

Nucleus cares deeply about inclusivity. To help everyone, we aim to understand the impact each and every decision we make.

Accessibility ensures that everyone can access and benefit from a website, system or application, regardless of their gender, age, culture, or ability.

At minimum, features must conform to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 at Level AA. Considerations must also be made around different screen sizes, browser types and settings.

The four accessibility principles we adhere to; Perceivable, Operable, Understandable and Robust (POUR) are defined in [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

Leave no one out. Inclusivity and accessibility are fundamental. No one should be left out. Ever.
