## Ratios and rules

### Aspect ratios

There are three aspect ratios used, 1:1, 4:3 and 16:9, which we use in various ways. Take a considered approach and do not overload with too many variants.

### Responsive rules

For all of the aspect ratios, there is a rule that all images scale proportionally to their ratio. This means that they will retain their shape from large screens to small ones.

The aspect ratios always scale proportionally. If it is a full-width image the highest width should be 1440px.
