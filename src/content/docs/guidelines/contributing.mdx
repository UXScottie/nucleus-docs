## Introduction

<div class="purpose">
The Nucleus design system is a living organism, one that reflects and evolves with collective learning.
</div>

## Our standards

To maintain high standards details will be focussed on evidence. This evidence might come from analytics or observations during user testing and is used to identify problems with the outcome of adding value.

Asking for evidence is important to ensure that the entire community has a clear understanding of why a change has been made.

## Responsibilities

The Nucleus team are guardians of Nucleus, making sure all of its parts work symbiotically.

Individuals at all levels are welcome to contribute, whether they have identified an issue that needs to be resolved or have other valuable insights to share.

### What is a contribution?

It starts with identifying a problem. Whether it's a problem with an existing component or pattern, or an improvement to the documentation. Maybe a pain-point with the prototyping tool. Every part of Nucleus is open to contributions.

A contribution:

- adds value
- can be something new, an improvement or a bug fix
- is reusable
- is inclusive and accessible
- is documented

### Who can contribute?

Everyone.

Individuals from various professional backgrounds, such as Designers, Software Engineers, Testers, Solutions Architects, Product Owners, and Directors, are all welcome to contribute to Nucleus.

## What to expect

Everyone involved in the process plays a significant role in creating a customer experience that is coherent, consistent, and engaging.

A contribution flow has been established by the community to ensure that any contribution made adheres to the standards set by Nucleus.

### Have you identified a problem?

If you have, please share the problem with the community. Asking if anyone else is aware of the same or similar problem.

You'll be surprised how many problems exist that are constantly overlooked and ignored, so any problem, no matter how big or small has the potential to add value.

If a solution will be...

- reusable by another team/journey
- a solution to a new problem or an extension of an existing solution

â€¦the chances are the idea would be a great contribution!

The chart below helps when making decisions about what to do:

### First step: creating a Proposal

If the idea in mind is not currently offered by Nucleus, is reusable by multiple teams or user journeys, and is solving a problem that cannot be solved presently, that can be considered Proposal material.

It is recommended to check the [Proposal board](https://github.com/ConnectedHomes/nucleus/projects/6) before raising a Proposal to ensure that no one else has already raised a similar idea.

If nothing similar has been raised, then go ahead and [create your Proposal](https://github.com/ConnectedHomes/nucleus/issues/new?assignees=&labels=RFC,+draft&template=b--proposal.md&title=%5BRFC%5D+Title+of+the+Proposal).

It is important to provide as many details as possible and answer the questions on the ticket template to ensure that the proposal meets all the requirements.

If assistance is required in answering some of the questions, reach out to the team on Nucleus' channels. They will be more than happy to help!

### Collaborate

As the Proposal is for something that has reusability potential, it's time to involve other teams that may have an interest in it. Reach out to colleagues to see if they may have requirements that can help them use your contribution once it's available.

Bring the Proposal to the Drop-in Clinique, it's a great way to receive feedback and interest from others.

**The person making the proposal should remember that they are the main sponsor of the Proposal**, but they can always seek support from the Nucleus team if they need to.

### Contribute

Take the following steps to work on a contribution:

- Add any user research into the Proposal ticket by commenting on it with user analytics, usability testing, A/B testing, etc.
- Share the final designs with the wider design team, and the Nucleus team for feedback.
- Start building your contribution with a product engineer.
- Build documentation for the contribution by adding to an existing document or creating a new one, for which assistance is available.
- Once the contribution is ready to be reviewed by the Nucleus team, share the pull request with them so that they can assess if it has been built following Nucleus coding standards for components.
******************************************************************************************************START HERE:
A contribution usually comprises:

- A design for a component/type/feature that can be added to the design libraries (Sketch/Figma).
- A built component/type/feature that can be added to our component library.
- Unit test for the component.
- Automated testing scenarios.

The best way is that you and your team own as much of the above as possible, but we can support you on anything if you need us to.

Once everything looks good to go, your contribution can be part of the next release and will be available to everyone using Nucleus!

And that's how a contribution is done!

### How to make the best contributions

Here are a few tips and tricks on how to make things as fast as possible:

- The best and quickest way is for you and your team to own as much of the work as possible. This way you do not depend on the availability of any other team to pick up the work. But do not worry, we can support you along the way if you need us.
- Check that there isn't a Proposal for the piece of work you have in mind already. You can find all the Proposals on the [kanban board](https://github.com/ConnectedHomes/nucleus/projects/6) and see their status.
- Share your design ideas as early and as often as possible with the community. You can do that on our Teams channels, or in the Drop-in Clinique sessions. This will help refine your design to make sure it works for the wider community.
- If you are designing an improvement to a component, make sure you are using the existing version first if it can do the job. That will give you a control version and benchmark to test your design against and see if it adds value by improving the experience/key metrics.
- The proposer is the driver. If you propose a change or an addition to Nucleus, you are the one who will be championing it.
- We are customer centred, and every contribution should add customer value and improve their experience. Try to apply the 'customer lens' to everything you contribute.

### Insights on existing Nucleus work

For any feedback related to our Nucleus components and related documentation, we're using Github. It helps us provide a transparent track of all contributions and potential issues.

1. You can view our [Proposals status](https://github.com/ConnectedHomes/nucleus/projects/6).
2. You can create [bug reports](https://github.com/ConnectedHomes/nucleus/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Bug&template=a--bug-report.md&title=%5Bbug%5D%20%5Bns-COMPONENT%5D), add a new [Proposal (RFC) request for comments](https://github.com/ConnectedHomes/nucleus/issues/new?assignees=&labels=RFC,+draft&template=b--proposal.md&title=%5BRFC%5D+Title+of+the+Proposal), as well as react or comment on existing feedback.

### Suggestions for new Nucleus assets

We're working hard to grow Nucleus without sacrificing quality.

1. You can track and add suggestions for new assets in Github by checking our [requests status](https://github.com/ConnectedHomes/nucleus/projects/6).
2. Feel free to explore the styles and assets provided to suggest new components.
3. Please make sure to submit your experiments and learning. It helps us to track potential variations and roll out stable additions to all teams via Nucleus.

To understand how the Nucleus team works, visit [Our Process](/guidelines/process).

### Feedback on anything related to Nucleus

Reach us on our [Teams channels](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3ac806c8b36aec4218ae469b1d0ff6a4c3%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=1f9c2411-216b-42a8-9bb0-c51f28ff5071&tenantId=a603898f-7de2-45ba-b67d-d35fb519b2cf), if there's anything on your mind.

### Events and updates

We know we don't have all the right answers, that's why we want to work with you in person, as well as connect you to other teams dealing with similar issues.

- We help to host and facilitate sessions and workshops focused on our current tasks as we go along. If you'd like us to help organise or be involved in something you're doing, do let us know.
- Just like other product teams, we're participating in weekly and monthly cross-team ceremonies.
