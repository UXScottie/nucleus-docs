## The vision

To create an industry leading design system that is known and respected across the community.

## The mission

Nucleus is an inclusive, community driven design system. It brings together our brand personality and world class experiences.

## The purpose

Empowering teams to collaboratively build reusable, coherent and accessible experiences that delight customers by using our aligned principles and processes.

## Accessibility principles

At minimum, features must conform to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 at Level AA.

Accessibility ensures that all persons can access and benefit from a website, system or application, regardless of their gender, age, culture, or ability. Considerations must also be made around different screen sizes, browser types and settings, or those who do not have plug-ins such as Flash.

The four accessibility principles we use; Perceivable, Operable, Understandable and Robust (POUR) are defined in [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

## Inclusivity principles

Leave no one out. Inclusivity and accessibility are fundamental. No one should be left out. Ever.
