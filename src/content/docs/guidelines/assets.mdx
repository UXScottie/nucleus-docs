## Icons

Icons are used within our design system to represent an object or action visually to our users.

### Decorative

Used as a visual aid for some functions, categories or actions. These are not used as a direct element of interaction themselves but can help to signify and support an action. It is recommended that these aren't used in isolation and should be accompanied by copy to add context.

There are two types of Decorative icons to choose from â€“ solid or outline (the default is solid). Be mindful to maintain the consistency when using in groups.

### Functional

Used to show where an action needs to be taken. This includes components like buttons or controls. For instance a button might include an arrow to give the user an indication of what will happen next or a download icon to show that the user will receive something by pressing it.

## Images

### Aspect ratios

There are three aspect ratios used, `1 / 1`, `4 / 3` and `16 / 9`, which we use in various ways. Take a considered approach, do not use lots of different aspect ratios.

### Responsive rules

For all of the aspect ratios, there is a rule that all images scale proportionally to their ratio. This means that they will retain their shape from large screens to small ones.

The aspect ratios always scale proportionally. If it is a full-width image the highest width should be 1440px.
