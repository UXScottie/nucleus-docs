### Cookie consent for video playback

The `ns-video` component includes a cookie consent feature to comply with user privacy preferences. It checks if the user has accepted 'Targeting Cookies' before enabling video playback. If not, the video remains inactive, and a message prompts the user to enable 'Targeting Cookies' and refresh the page. Alternatively, users can watch the video on YouTube.

This feature ensures users are informed about their cookie settings, maintaining transparency and adhering to privacy regulations.
