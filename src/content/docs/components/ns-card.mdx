### Considerations

- Keep the type of CTA consistent across a group of cards.
- Always add heading to the group of cards inside the panel.
- Place the pill in the same location across the group of cards to improve the readability of the cards.

## Implementation

### Placement

<Placement name={componentName} />

### Specification

<Specification name={componentName} />

#### Specification notes

#### `<ns-pill>`

To add a [`<ns-pill>`](/components/ns-pill) to the card it needs to be placed inside one of the slots. Be careful about using it within the heading slot, as the pill content will be read out as part of the heading for screen readers.

##### Screen readers with ns-pill

```html
<ns-card>
  <h3 slot="heading">
    <ns-pill>Special Offer</ns-pill>
    Get energy with us
  </h3>
  ...
</ns-card>
```

In the above example the screen reader will read out "Special Offer Get energy with us". Make sure that is what is expected. Remember the pill cannot be used on its own within a heading. Our advice is to rarely put pills in headings as they are normally conveying a message related to the heading, but is not heading content.
