## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

Cards are to be used to apply a container around a related grouping of information. Achieve this through a combination of imagery, illustrations and typography.

    To group content only using visual proximity, with no background.
    <ExampleViewer type="flat" />

## Guidance

:::do
- Use to group content that belongs together about a specific item, action, etc..
- Use to direct customers to the actions.
- Embolden text in the paragraph that is important.
- Make the [CTA](/components/ns-cta) (Call To Action) wording unique, stating the action.
- The visual in the image or illustration should be related to the content of the card
- Consider adding a [decoration](/components/ns-panel/#specification-attribute-decoration) to the panel to emphasise the cards.
- Use "support" type in a one-column layout at basketball-court when you have 3 elements in a row to avoid widow cards and empty spaces on small to medium viewports.
:::

:::dont
- Mix different card types in a row.
- Have more than one CTA on a card.
- Repeat the CTA wording on each card.
- Use support type cards in 2 column layouts at basketball (use standard cards or set layout to 1 column)
- Use in place of the [`<ns-product-card>`](/components/ns-product-card) component.

### Considerations

- Keep the type of CTA consistent across a group of cards.
- Always add heading to the group of cards inside the panel.
- Place the pill in the same location across the group of cards to improve the readability of the cards.

## Implementation

### Placement

<Placement name={componentName} />

### Specification

<Specification name={componentName} />

#### Specification notes

#### `<ns-pill>`

To add a [`<ns-pill>`](/components/ns-pill) to the card it needs to be placed inside one of the slots. Be careful about using it within the heading slot, as the pill content will be read out as part of the heading for screen readers.

##### Screen readers with ns-pill

```html
<ns-card>
  <h3 slot="heading">
    <ns-pill>Special Offer</ns-pill>
    Get energy with us
  </h3>
  ...
</ns-card>
```

In the above example the screen reader will read out "Special Offer Get energy with us". Make sure that is what is expected. Remember the pill cannot be used on its own within a heading. Our advice is to rarely put pills in headings as they are normally conveying a message related to the heading, but is not heading content.
