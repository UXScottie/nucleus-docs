## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />
(Purpose, to be added dynamically:)
Creates space for product upsells and recommendations, engaging users with a horizontally scrollable list to explore and choose from various options without extending the page length.

### Examples (TBD)

<ExampleViewer type="standard" />

## Guidance

:::do
- Use when there are 2 or more items
- Consider the position of the content. Items in the first few positions could be seen and interacted with more than those that are effectively hidden.
- Use the same type of content for the entire scroller, (eg. all `ns-card` components with images and direct CTAs).
:::

:::dont
- Use excessively long content. Users should not need to vertcially scroll in addition when horizontally scrolling.
- Idealy use more than 9 items in one `ns-scroller` to keep cognitive load manageable for the user (Hick's law).
- Override with with custom CSS for aesthetics, as this can cause issues elsewhere and creates technical debt.
- Nest a `ns-scroller` within another.
