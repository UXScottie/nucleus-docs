## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

The appointment-picker comprises a calendar to select a date and a radio-button type inputter to show the available time slots for the selected date.

### Examples

<ExampleViewer type="standard" />

## Guidance

:::do
- Use this when the customer needs to select a date and a time slot for an appointment.
- Use `ns-inputter` to surface the best suitable slots for a customer before presenting the full appointment picker, where appropriate.
- Use `ns-alert` alongside `ns-appointment-picker` to surface any important notifications regarding a customer booking.
- Use multiple appointment pickers in ns-tabs so users can easily access different types of bookings.
:::

:::dont
- Use to select an appointment slot on a single date. Use `ns-inputter` radio options instead.
- Force customers to use the appointment picker first if there is very poor appointment availability. Present the next available appointments in an `ns-inputter` radio first.
