## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />
The component is a small coloured highlight. Use `ns-pill` to highlight a small item of information to a customer. Within the British Gas experience, they are often used to attract attention to a promotional message or a notification. Only display a small detail of the content. The `ns-pill` component should not contain lengthy or complex information.

Pills can help to create a subtle sense of urgency or to draw a customerâ€™s attention to the value of a product or service. For example, use them to highlight the date a promotional offer expires or to feature a gift offer.
