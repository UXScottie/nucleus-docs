## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

Users can perform particular actions through the use of the `ns-cta` component. An example of these actions could be to submit a form through an event (i.e. a click event) or navigate with a hyperlink.

There is no distinction between a hyperlink or an action through the design of the `ns-cta` component. Use its textual content to convey the intent of the CTA to the user.

### Examples

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Direct">
    <ExampleViewer type="standard" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Text">
    <ExampleViewer type="text" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Guidance

:::do
- Make it short and actionable.
- Only use `loading` on an action that will take between 1 and 5 seconds.
- Relate the action to the content it sits beside.
- Use `direct` type for the most important action on the page.
- Use `text` type to support the direct action.
- Use instead of a native button.
- Use `submit` type in a form for form submission.
- Use `reset` type in a form for form reset action.
:::

:::dont
- Make it vague.
- Make it overly wordy.
- Change the icon for the sake of it.
- Use more than 24 characters.
- Have CTAs within a paragraph.
- Repeat the CTA copy within the same page.
- Use for downloads. Use [`<ns-download>`](/components/ns-download) instead.

#### Key

| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <span class="marker">A</span> | Text | Keep the text 'short, relevant, and actionable'. It should not exceed more than 24 characters. |
| <span class="marker">B</span> | Icon | This is a decoration. It is intended to imply direction such as moving forwards and backwards in a journey. The [specification](#specification) has a list of options. |

## Implementation

### Placement

<Placement name={componentName} />

### Specification

<Specification name={componentName} />

#### Specification notes

##### Icons

They are decorative, not descriptive, and are there to supplement the text.

##### `href`

- Can be used instead of having a wrapping `<a>` element.
- This shouldn't be used if a `click` event is added.
