## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

The `ns-frame` component comprises a header and buttons that are adjacent to an anonymous content area. When a button is clicked, it navigates through the content. This component should not be used in conjunction with the `ns-header`. It is particularly useful in scenarios such as when a user is logged into their account.

### Examples

<ExampleViewer type="standard" />

## Guidance

:::do
- Keep button labels short and concise, ideally single words.
- Ensure labels are composed of words that resonate with customers.
- Keep the data in the menu to a minimum.
- Use the menu for customer account management.

:::

:::dont
- Use business terminology for the button labels.
- Hide header unless using within an app.
- Use buttons to link to pages outside of `ns-frame`.
- Place customer account management links within the buttons.

#### Key

| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <span class="marker">A</span> | Account menu | Include relevant account management information in the menu that appears when the Account button is clicked.  |
| <span class="marker">B</span> | Search | When Search is shown, it will contain the value of the `name` attribute, allowing for personalisation. Refer to the [`show-search` attribute](##specification-attribute-show-search) on how to use this option. |
| <span class="marker">C</span> | Buttons | Each button includes an icon and a label and an associated url.  When the number of buttons exceeds the visible space, it becomes scrollable. There is an option to hide the buttons. Refer to the [Specification] (#specification) for how to use this option.|
| <span class="marker">D</span> | Anonymous slot | To contain [`<ns-panel>`](/components/ns-panel). Pay attention to how the content displays at all resolutions. [`<nsx-footer>`](/components/nsx-footer) should be the last component. |
