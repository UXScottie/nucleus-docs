## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

The `ns-frame` component comprises a header and buttons that are adjacent to an anonymous content area. When a button is clicked, it navigates through the content. This component should not be used in conjunction with the `ns-header`. It is particularly useful in scenarios such as when a user is logged into their account.

### Examples

<ExampleViewer type="standard" />

## Guidance

:::do

- Keep labels short, ideally single words.
- Minimise the number of menu options.
- Strive for concise labels.
- Ensure labels are composed of words that resonate with customers.
- Use this as the primary navigation.
- Utilise the account menu in the header for customer account management items.
- Employ menu items as overarching categories for customer content.

:::

:::dont

- Nest one navigation within another â€“ it can confuse the user experience.
- Use business terminology for the labels on the navigation.
- Hide navigation items unless absolutely necessary.
- Use menu items to link to pages outside of the logged-in experience.
- Place core account management items within the left-hand menu.
- Incorporate actions as navigation menu items.

#### Key

| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <span class="marker">A</span> | Header | Frames the top of the page with a logo and an interactive icon. This icon, along with its label, does not serve general navigation purposes. Instead, it activates a drop-down menu that presents items such as account information. There are also various Search options to choose from - refer to the [examples](/components/ns-frame#examples) provided above. |
| <span class="marker">B</span> | Buttons | Each button includes an icon and a label and has states for active, hover, and selected. All buttons are contained within the menu, which becomes scrollable when the number of buttons exceeds the visible space. There is also the flexibility to hide all items, display as few as two, or show many items in the menu. |
| <span class="marker">C</span> | Menu scroll chevrons | These are interactive elements that provide visual cues and a method to navigate through the menu of buttons. This allows buttons positioned outside the visible area to be scrolled into view. These chevrons will automatically disappear if the number of buttons fits within the visible area. |
| <span class="marker">D</span> | Anonymous slot | Include headings, lists and paragraphs. Divide content into short paragraphs as it is easier to consume, and aids effective page scanning. Include emphasis with `<strong>`, inline links `<a>`, lists `<ul>` `<ol>`. Add a [caveat link](/components/ns-caveat) if required. This should be followed by the [nsx-footer](/components/nsx-footer) to indicate the end of the page. |
