## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

The `ns-frame` component comprises a header and buttons that are adjacent to an anonymous content area. When a button is clicked, it navigates through the content.

The `ns-frame` component should not be used in conjunction with the `ns-header` and it can only be utilised as a child of the `<main>` element.

The `ns-frame` component is particularly useful in scenarios such as when a user is logged into their account.

### Examples

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Standard">
    <ExampleViewer type="standard" />
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>


## Guidance

:::do

- Keep labels short, ideally single words.
- Minimise the number of menu options.
- Strive for concise labels.
- Ensure labels are composed of words that resonate with customers.
- Use this as the primary navigation.
- Utilise the account menu in the header for customer account management items.
- Employ menu items as overarching categories for customer content.

:::

:::dont

- Nest one navigation within another â€“ it can confuse the user experience.
- Use business terminology for the labels on the navigation.
- Hide navigation items unless absolutely necessary.
- Use menu items to link to pages outside of the logged-in experience.
- Place core account management items within the left-hand menu.
- Incorporate actions as navigation menu items.
