## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

### Examples

<ExampleViewer type="standard" />

## Guidance

:::do
- Use to indicate progress of journey.
- Info and Next parts should show a statement describing the step.
- Keep Info and Next statements concise or omit if unnecessary or duplicating content.
- Keep steps to a minimum for perceived simplicity.
- Use up to 20 steps but ideally not more than 10.
- Use decimal places to reduce the number of overall steps.
- Use JavaScript to dynamically update the component rather than re-add on each page.
- Use the completed state on the confirmation page.
:::

:::dont
- Use to show anything else such as loading.
- Use questions on Info and Next - keep it informative.
- Omit one step but not the rest for Info - instead use an 'all or nothing approach'.
- Nest as sub-process.
- Use less than 2 steps.
- Use more than 1 on a page.
- Use the last step as the confirmation page.
