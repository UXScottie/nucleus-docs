## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

The header provides the primary navigation and conveys brand presence with the logo.

:::note
This is the UI component for the header - if you are looking for the header that includes the navigational content, please use [nsx-header](#).
:::

The nsx-header should be the default choice of header across the main British Gas website.

### Examples

<ExampleViewer type="standard" />

## Guidance

:::do
- Create your own header if you are a micro site or external partner.
- Follow the correct structure for the navigation links.
- Have a header on every page.
:::

:::dont
- Make your own header if you are part of the customer facing website.
- Add personalisation links into the navigation, as this can have an SEO issue.
- Load links from an API of external source as this has a performance impact.
- Add the header inside the `<main>` element.

## Implementation

### Placement

<Placement name={componentName} />

### Specification

<Specification name={componentName} />

#### Specification notes

##### Logo

- Only change if the header will be used in a non British Gas journey, for example a partnership with Bord Gais.
- Remember to give a new `alt` value.
- Logo can only have a max height of `62px` i.e. the British Gas logo is 160px x 62px.
- Hosting of the logo should be within our own systems not pointing to an outside resource.

##### Alt

This is the alt for the logo, so should be the company name.

##### Hide links

Add this attribute when there is no navigational links (when there is nothing in the anonymous slot).

##### Dynamic link slot

- This is a dynamic slot.
- This must follow a flat DOM structure of just an anchor tag.
- The suffix of the slot corresponds to the the `data-link` attribute value on the link you want to take over.
- The link should be given text content and should correlate to what the link text content was previously.

##### Primary structure

This is an array of each navigation section. Each navigation section is an object.

Each section:

- `heading`
- `href`
- `subheading`
  - `heading`
  - `links`
    - `text`
    - `href`
    - `data-link`

```json
[
  {
    "heading": "Energy",
    "href": "/energy.html",
    "subheadings": [
      {
        "heading": "Gas & electricity",
        "links": [
          {
            "text": "Gas & electricity services",
            "href": "/energy.html"
          },
          {
            "text": "Our gas & electricity tariffs",
            "href": "/energy/gas-and-electricity.html"
          },
          {
            "text": "Get a quote",
            "href": "/GetAQuote/"
          },
          {
            "text": "Connections for new builds",
            "href": "/energy/gas-and-electricity/new-connections.html"
          },
          {
            "text": "Warm Home Discount",
            "href": "/energy/energy-saving/warm-home-discount.html"
          }
        ]
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
  ...
]
```
