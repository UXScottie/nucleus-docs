## Guidance

:::do
- Use text or `ns-card` within `additional content` to provide additional information.
- Use either default, icon or number decoration for all events in the timeline sequence for the `standard` variant.
- Use either number or fallback decoration for all events in the timeline sequence for the `Step` variant.
:::

:::dont
- Add status to an event for the `step` variant.
- Mix two different decoration types in events.
- Use any icon type with names ending `solid` or `outline`.
:::

### Status

Each event has a status. The status of the event is controlled by the decoration used.

| Style | Status | Description |
| :--- | :------ | :------ |
| ![pending](@assets/components/ns-timeline-event/status-pending.webp)| `pending` |Communicates that the event has yet to commence. |
| ![in progress](@assets/components/ns-timeline-event/status-in-progress.webp) | `inprogress` | Indicates that progress is currently being made on this step. |
| ![success](@assets/components/ns-timeline-event/status-completed.webp) | `completed` | The event has been successfully completed. |
| ![action required](@assets/components/ns-timeline-event/status-action-required.webp) | `actionrequired` | This is used when a customer needs to take action in order to proceed with the process. |
| ![warning](@assets/components/ns-timeline-event/status-warning.webp) | `warning` | Informs of a problem with low severity such as foreseeable delays or outages etc. The problem is expected to be automatically resolved as the situation changes. |
| ![error](@assets/components/ns-timeline-event/status-error.webp) | `error` | This is a failure indication. Something couldn't be resolved and so has halted the whole process marking other `inprogress`\ `pending` event(s) `cancelled`. It should be accompanied by a helpful message. |

### Icons & numerals

There are 3 styles of timeline to choose from in the 'overview decorations' - default, icon, or number.

#### Default

Uses a circle and implies nothing other than it is an event.

#### Icons

These can be selected from a list to help convey meaning for each event and make it easier to identify a step. If selected, all events will need an icon chosen from the list.

#### Numbers

For use when an order should be shown.

Some icons are special and automatically reserved for use only with a particular status, such as Complete tick, Action required arrow, Warning triangle, and Error diamond. These show on all the variants of 'overview decoration'.
