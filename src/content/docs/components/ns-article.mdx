#### Key

| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <span class="marker">A</span> | Heading | The recommended length is between 4 and 12 words, not exceeding 50 characters in total. |
| <span class="marker">B</span> | Media | Videos should be hosted on YouTube and have an aspect ratio of 16:9. Images can have an aspect ratio of 16:9 or 4:3, their file type should be jpg, and the file size should be no more than 100kb. Don't use imagery with white backgrounds. |
| <span class="marker">C</span> | Caption | Short contextual description of the video or image content. |
| <span class="marker">D</span> | Content | The content should be concise and use sub headings to introduce each piece. Divide content into short paragraphs as it is easier to consume, and aids effective page scanning. Content can contain bold copy `<b>` `<strong>`, inline links `<a>`, lists `<ul>` `<ol>`, and a caveat at the end of the relevant paragraph if required `<a href="#caveat">1</a>`. |
| <span class="marker">E</span> | Call to action | Keep the text ‘short, relevant, and actionable’. It should not exceed more than 10 characters. |
