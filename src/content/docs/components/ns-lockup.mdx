#### Key

| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <span class="marker">A</span> | Heading | The recommended length is between 4 and 12 words, not exceeding 50 characters in total. |
| <span class="marker">B</span> | Content | The content can accommodate multiple paragraph slots. However, be mindful of keeping it concise. Our guidance is a maximum of 2 short paragraphs, each with no more than 3 lines each. Can contain bold copy `<b>`, inline links `<a>`,  lists `<ul>` `<ol>`, and a caveat at the end of the relevant paragraph if required `<a href="#caveat">1</a>`. |
| <span class="marker">C</span> | CTA | Keep the text ‘short, relevant, and actionable’. It should not exceed more than 24 characters. |
| <span class="marker">D</span> | Image | There is a choice between 3 image sizes - the first has an aspect ratio of 16:9, the dimensions should be 800 x 450px, the second has an aspect ratio of 4:3, the dimensions should be 800 x 600px, and the third has an aspect ratio of 1:1, the dimensions should be 800 x 800px. Both versions should be jpg file types, and the file size should be no more than 100kb. To see which image you can use - please see the [Image guidance section](#image-guidance) below. Don't use imagery with white backgrounds. Please make sure you work with a designer when selecting any imagery for the `ns-lockup`. |

### Specification notes

#### Video

- Use the `video` variant when using a video instead of an image as the overlap is in front of the text box so neither the video nor its captions are obscured. The text then wraps around the video edge. (See the `video` example above)
- It is not possible to use an illustration decoration with a video.
- Use the video's YouTube link as the `id` attribute's value.
