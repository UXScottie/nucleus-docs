## Overview

<CompDetails name={componentName} />

Allows the user interface to split into multiple columns by defining the number of columns required at specific viewports.

Use for arranging components and content, not for gratuitous numerous columns as perhaps seen in a newspaper or magazine.

### Examples

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Standard">
    <ExampleViewer type="standard" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Extended">
    <ExampleViewer type="standard" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Guidance

:::do
- Pick the number of columns to complement the content.
- Test the full responsive range of your page's and not just the defined viewports.
- Try to stick to one column as much as possible .
- Try to avoid having widowed items.
- Use the ratio options to add side panels.
:::

:::dont
- Have complicated column structures, try to simplify your content first.
- Use in components that are too small to support multiple components.
- Use to put components in columns that are designed to be standalone.
- Use to create newspaper style columns and layouts.
