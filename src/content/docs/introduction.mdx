### Why do we have a design system?

Nucleus exists so we can efficiently design consistent and accessible experiences for our customers. Each element of the design system has been rigorously researched, designed, built and tested, to conform with our [principles](../guidelines/principles). By completing this discovery work, we hope that everyone is able to concentrate on creating consistent and coherent experiences for our customers.

### How has the design system been created?

Nucleus is built from small elements, such as typographic styles, colours, scale and visual assets - these form our foundations.

These foundations are brought together to form components. These range from elemental items such as a CTA - which comprises an icon and text, to more complex organisms containing multiple typographic styles and/or visual elements.

Through continuous exploration and implementation we also have begun to develop patterns. These are highly complex structures, which contain groups of elements or components.
